# pychrono-examples
A collection of ready-to-use PyChrono examples.

As a rule of thumb, each folder focuses on one class of models. For instance, `vehicle` contains examples of vehicles. In general, there is a subfolder `misc` that contains all sorts of models. The mode special vehicle models have their own folders, which might contain assets needed for carrying out the simulation experiment.

Note that it is not always clear in which folder a model belongs. Some calls needed to be made. 

Please feel free to do pull requests, we'd love to enrich the family of PyChrono models with your help. Thanks for considering doing this.
